* "Core" Go

- `go`: compiler, runtime, standard library
- `tools`: extra tools and tooling packages
- `crypto`: supplementary cryptography packages
- `net`: supplementary network packages
- `build`: continuous build and release infrastructure

Many more: `mobile`, `lint`, `debug`, `blog`, `tour`...

* The state of things

- Gerrit is used for code review

- `build.golang.org` integrates with Gerrit as a CI

- GitHub is used for issue tracking

- GitHub branches are just mirrors

- GitHub PRs kind of work now, but we're not going to use them today

* Terminology

- CLA: contributor license agreement, proof that you are entitled to contribute

- change or CL (changelist): same as a Pull Request, but on Gerrit

- `+2`, `+1`, `-1`, `-2`: levels to approve or reject a CL

* Documentation

- We will follow https://tip.golang.org/doc/contribute.html

- Use the tip version, as it's newer and better

- Highly recommended that you use `go-contrib-init` and `git-codereview`

- `git-codereview` lets you do Gerrit actions, like `git-codereview mail` to upload a CL. Everything else can be plain Git.
